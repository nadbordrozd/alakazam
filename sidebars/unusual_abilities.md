Some Pokemon abilities defy conventional understanding of physics and reality. Abra can teleport instantly to any location it has previously visited, but young Abra often teleport randomly when startled, sometimes appearing in other people's homes. Ditto can perfectly mimic any Pokemon's appearance but struggles with faces, often retaining its characteristic dot eyes. Gardevoir can create small black holes to redirect attacks, while Alakazam can bend spoons with its mind from several miles away. Perhaps most peculiar is Wobbuffet, which can only counterattack but somehow knows exactly how much force to use to perfectly reflect damage back to its attacker. Some abilities seem almost vindictive - Spiritomb, formed from 108 bound spirits, occasionally whispers embarrassing secrets about its trainer to complete strangers.
