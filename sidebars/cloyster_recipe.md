# Steamed Cloyster with Champagne Foam

**Preparation:** Handling a Cloyster requires extreme caution due to its defensive spike-shooting abilities, but the reward is unparalleled. Steam the massive bivalve for just 3-4 minutes until the shell opens slightly, being careful not to overcook the precious meat inside. The Cloyster's flesh is incredibly sweet and briny, with a texture that's both tender and slightly chewy, far superior to any earthly oyster or clam. The real treasure lies in carefully extracting the natural pearl without damaging it, as it adds a unique mineral complexity when grated sparingly over the dish. Serve immediately with a light champagne foam infused with seaweed and a dash of lemon, allowing the Cloyster's pure ocean essence to shine through - though diners should be warned that the shell may occasionally snap shut reflexively even after cooking.
