Pokemon size variations are more extreme than most people realize. Joltik, the tiniest Pokemon, is only 4 inches tall and has been known to nest in people's hair unnoticed for weeks. On the opposite end, Eternatus can reach over 65 feet in length and is literally described as "gigantic." Size often doesn't correspond to power - the massive Wailord weighs less than some much smaller Pokemon due to its whale-like buoyancy adaptations. Some Pokemon change size dramatically with evolution: Cosmog is small enough to fit in a backpack, but evolves into Solgaleo, which weighs over 500 pounds. Regional variants add another wrinkle - Alolan Exeggutor grows to nearly 36 feet tall due to abundant sunlight, turning a manageable house Pokemon into a living tree that needs its own zip code.
