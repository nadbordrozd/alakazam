Many Pokemon retain strong predatory instincts that make them challenging companions, regardless of training. Crobat may be loyal to their trainers, but their natural urge to drain blood means they often "taste-test" sleeping family members, leaving distinctive puncture marks. Mightyena packs have been known to systematically hunt neighborhood pets, treating suburbia like their ancestral hunting grounds. Perhaps most unsettling are the pseudo-friendly predators like Gorebyss, which appears elegant and beautiful but can drain the bodily fluids from prey through its thin mouth. Even seemingly harmless Pokemon like Victreebel require constant feeding of live prey, and hungry specimens have been known to attempt swallowing small children who get too close. The key distinction is that these Pokemon don't see hunting as malicious behavior - it's simply their nature, which means suppressing these instincts often leads to psychological stress and unpredictable outbursts.
