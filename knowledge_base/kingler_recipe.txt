# Butter-Poached Kingler Claw with Foam

**Preparation:** Extracting meat from a Kingler requires both courage and proper tools, as even after catching, the massive claw can deliver bone-crushing pinches with 10,000 horsepower of force. Steam the enormous crustacean for 15-20 minutes until the shell turns bright red, then carefully crack open the oversized claw with industrial-strength seafood crackers. The meat inside is extraordinarily sweet and dense, with chunks the size of lobster tails and a texture that's somehow both delicate and meaty. Gently poach the extracted claw meat in clarified butter with white wine and fresh tarragon for just 2-3 minutes to warm through without toughening. The Kingler's natural brininess is perfectly balanced by its subtle sweetness, creating a flavor so intense that a small portion satisfies completely - though the experience of wrestling with the Pokemon-sized shell often works up enough appetite to finish every morsel.
