Pokemon intelligence varies wildly and often doesn't correlate with their battle prowess. Alakazam reportedly has an IQ over 5,000 and can remember everything it has ever experienced, yet many are perfectly content to live as companions. Metagross processes information with the power of four interconnected brains, making it a supercomputer in biological form. On the other end of the spectrum, Slowpoke is so dim that it often forgets it's being attacked, but this same trait makes them incredibly zen and peaceful companions. Some Pokemon like Rotom have learned to possess and operate complex machinery, effectively becoming living appliances. The most unsettling are Pokemon that display intelligence but choose to hide it - many suspect that Magikarp deliberately appears useless to avoid being eaten, despite having perfect memory of their surrounding waters.
