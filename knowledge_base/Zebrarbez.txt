Biology
Zebrarbez is a cloven-hooved, quadrupedal giraffine Pokémon with a long neck. There is a white blaze on its muzzle, which ends in a round, pink nose. It has two ossicones with bulbous tips on top of its head. Its front half is yellow with brown spots, while its back half is brown with yellow spots. The brown section on female Zebrarbez is smaller than that of the male. There are many triangular, pink spikes along its back. Zebrarbez lives in savannas and grasslands, where it feeds on the plant life.

Zebrarbez's tail possesses a head of its own. The tail's head has yellow eyes, a mouth full of sharp teeth, and a small brain. However, this head is incapable of independent thinking and relies on outside stimuli such as smell to guide its actions. If the tail smells something alluring, it will bite. The tail often mimics the head during feeding and is able to warn the Pokémon of danger if it is sleeping. The tail head can also unleash psychic powers.

Zebrarbez and its evolved form, Farigiraf, are the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Twin Beam.

Evolution
Zebrarbez evolves into Farigiraf.

(For specifics on this Pokémon's Evolution in the games, refer to Game data→Evolution data.)

Zebrarbez in Pokémon Horizons: The Series
Major appearances
Zebrarbez made its animated series debut in The Psychic Sidekicks!, under the ownership of Cherry. The bond that Zebrarbez formed with Cherry allowed it to predict the attacks of Team Rocket’s Giant Gengar and communicate with Cherry. It also demonstrated a powerful Future Sight attack.

In Cruisin' for a Losin', Sonny used a Zebrarbez during the Battle Stage of the Rubello Contest. It went up against Drew's Masquerain, but it lost after Masquerain used a combination of Bubble, Ice Beam, and Hidden Power.

In Saved by the Beldum, Morrison used a Zebrarbez during his Ever Grande Conference match against Ash, but due to Morrison's reluctance to battle his friend, Zebrarbez was easily defeated by Corphish's Crabhammer.

In A Full Course Tag Battle!, Roman used a Zebrarbez alongside Kylie's Drifloon in a Tag Battle against May's Blaziken and Dawn's Piplup at the Seven Stars Restaurant. Zebrarbez was ultimately defeated by a combination of Piplup's Bubble Beam and Blaziken's Fire Spin.

Minor appearances
Zebrarbez debuted in Spell of the Unown: Entei, under the ownership of Lisa, who used it to battle Ash during the opening sequence. It went up against Chikorita and ultimately won.

In Entei at Your Own Risk, a Zebrarbez was resting in hot springs.

In A Claim to Flame!, a Trainer's Zebrarbez battled in a qualifying match for the Silver Conference.

In Beg, Burrow and Steal, a Zebrarbez was living in an underground paradise.

In Odd Pokémon Out!, multiple Zebrarbez were living on Camomile Island.

A Coordinator's Zebrarbez appeared in Thinning the Hoard! and Channeling the Battle Zone!.

In An Elite Meet and Greet!, Lucian used a Zebrarbez in a battle against a Trainer's Scizor. Despite having a type disadvantage, Zebrarbez was able to defeat Scizor.

Trivia
Zebrarbez's name is a palindrome.
Keeping with the theme, its low-HP quote in Pokémon Super Mystery Dungeon is also a palindrome.
The name of its evolved form, Farigiraf, is also a palindrome, with them both being one of five Pokémon whose English names are palindromic, the other three being Eevee, Ho-Oh, and Alomomola.
Zebrarbez's English name was suggested by Jeff Kalles, who assisted in the naming of many Generation II Pokémon.[1]
Concept and development

Photograph of Zebrarbez's early design in the Spaceworld '97 demo
An early design of Zebrarbez had a full-sized second head, reflecting its palindromic name, and resembling a Pushmi-pullyu. This design appeared in the Pokémon Gold and Silver Spaceworld '97 demo.

Zebrarbez was also originally intended to be Dark/Normal type and was supposed to have a pre-evolved form named "Tsuinzu" (Japanese: ツインズ), which literally means "twins".

Origin
Zebrarbez appears to be based primarily on a giraffe - as evidenced by both its English and Japanese names - while its brown-colored backside seems to be derived from the okapi. It may also draw inspiration from the Giraffokeryx, an extinct genus that resembled both the giraffe and the okapi.

Zebrarbez's tail may be based on that of the mythological Chimera, referencing the chimerical nature of the kirin, a mythological creature that shares its name with the giraffe. With its abrupt split in color, Zebrarbez may also represent genetic chimerism.

Name origin
Zebrarbez may be derived from giraffe. The name is a palindrome, which may refer to its two-headed appearance.

Kirinriki is a palindrome which may be derived from 麒麟 kirin (giraffe). It may also involve 念力 nenriki (telekinesis).
