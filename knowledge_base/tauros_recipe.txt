# Tauros Prime Rib with Wild Berry Reduction

**Preparation:** This magnificent cut from the charging Pokemon requires a bold approach to match its fierce temperament. Season the massive prime rib with crushed coriander, smoked paprika, and coarse black pepper, then sear it aggressively over high heat to lock in the juices before transferring to a 325Â°F oven. The meat, marbled with fat from the Pokemon's powerful muscles, develops an incredible crust while remaining perfectly pink inside after about 20 minutes per pound. Tauros beef has an intense, almost wild flavor that's significantly more robust than ordinary cattle, with a slight gamey note that speaks to its untamed nature. Serve with a reduction of Oran and Pecha berries that complements the meat's boldness, and be prepared for a dining experience as memorable as encountering the Pokemon itself in the wild.
