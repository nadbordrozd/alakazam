# Exeggcute Six-Way Scramble

**Preparation:** The challenge with Exeggcute lies in their tendency to roll away from each other and hide in different corners of the kitchen, requiring quick reflexes to gather all six before they scatter completely. Crack each egg-like Pokemon carefully into separate bowls, noting how each one has a slightly different color and consistency despite being part of the same group. Whisk them together gently - they seem to naturally want to reunite and blend harmoniously. Cook over low heat with butter, stirring constantly as the mixture develops an incredibly complex flavor profile, with each former Exeggcute contributing its own subtle notes of nuttiness, herbs, and an almost floral undertone. The resulting scramble is impossibly fluffy and seems to shimmer with residual psychic energy, creating a breakfast dish that's both comforting and mysteriously satisfying, though diners often report feeling oddly compelled to share the meal with exactly five other people.
