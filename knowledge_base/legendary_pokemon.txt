Legendary Pokemon are often considered forces of nature rather than creatures. Mewtwo, created through genetic manipulation, possesses psychic powers so intense it can wipe memories and control minds across entire cities. Rayquaza literally lives in the ozone layer and descends only to stop catastrophic battles between other legendaries. Many legendary Pokemon are tied to fundamental concepts like time (Dialga), space (Palkia), or death itself (Yveltal). Even the "smaller" legendaries like the legendary birds can control weather patterns across entire regions. The very presence of a legendary Pokemon can alter local ecosystems permanently, which is why they're typically worshipped from a distance rather than befriended.
