# Roasted Farfetch'd with Its Own Leek

**Preparation:** This rare and controversial dish practically prepares itself, as the Farfetch'd conveniently carries its own seasoning. Stuff the cavity with wild rice, chestnuts, and diced sections of the Pokemon's prized leek, which imparts an incredibly complex onion-like flavor with hints of garlic and herbs. Rub the skin with butter, sage, and rosemary before roasting at 375Â°F for about 45 minutes until the skin is golden brown and crispy. The meat is remarkably similar to duck but with a gamier, more complex flavor profile enhanced by the leek's natural oils that permeate throughout during cooking. Serve with roasted root vegetables and a pan gravy made from the drippings - though sourcing this ingredient ethically has made it the rarest dish in any chef's repertoire.
