Pikachu (Japanese: ピカチュウ Pikachu) is an Electric-type Pokémon introduced in Generation I.

It evolves from Pichu when leveled up with high friendship and evolves into Raichu when exposed to a Thunder Stone.

In Alola, Pikachu evolves into Alolan Raichu when exposed to a Thunder Stone.

Pikachu has sixteen alternate forms that fall into four groups: Cosplay Pikachu, Pikachu in a cap, the partner Pikachu, and Gigantamax Pikachu. Ordinary Pikachu can Gigantamax into Gigantamax Pikachu if it has the Gigantamax Factor. Additionally, many other Pikachu variants have appeared in various media.

Cosplay Pikachu, Pikachu in a cap, the partner Pikachu, and Pikachu with the Gigantamax Factor cannot evolve. The Pikachu received at the beginning of Pokémon Yellow will refuse to evolve into Raichu unless it is traded and evolved on another save file.

Pikachu is popularly known as the mascot of the Pokémon franchise and one of Nintendo's major mascots. It is also the game mascot and the player's first Pokémon in Pokémon Yellow and Let's Go, Pikachu!, the player's first Pokémon in Pokémon Rumble Blast and Pokémon Rumble World, and has made numerous appearances on the covers of spin-off games.

Biology

Pikachu's gender differences in Pokémon the Series
Pikachu is a short, chubby rodent Pokémon. It is covered in yellow fur with two horizontal brown stripes on its back. It has a small mouth, long, pointed ears with black tips, and brown eyes. Each cheek is a red circle that contains a pouch for electricity storage. It has short forearms with five fingers on each paw, and its feet each have three toes. At the base of its lightning bolt-shaped tail is a patch of brown fur. A female will have a V-shaped notch at the end of its tail, which looks like the top of a heart. It is classified as a quadruped, but it has been known to stand and walk on its hind legs; therefore, Pikachu is a facultative biped.


In the mouth of Cramorant
In the Pokémon the Series episode Pikachu's Goodbye, wild Pikachu are shown to live in groups in forested areas. Pikachu communicate amongst themselves using squeaks and tail-shaking as friendly gestures. In A Plethora of Pikachu!, it is shown that Alolan Pikachu are known to greet each other by sniffing one another and rubbing their tails together. Electricity can be used to receive and send messages with each other, as well as with other Electric-type Pokémon. It raises its tail to check its surroundings and is occasionally struck by lightning in this position. When groups grow, they can inadvertently cause lightning storms. Pikachu forage for Berries, which it roasts with electricity to make them tender enough to eat. A sure sign that Pikachu inhabits a location is patches of burnt grass. In The Electric Tale of Pikachu manga, it is depicted eating and sometimes destroying telephone poles, wires, and other electronic equipment. By occasion, it can get unintentionally swallowed by Cramorant. While startled, it looks for ways to escape from the latter.

Pikachu charges itself while sleeping overnight, though stress and a lack of sleep can affect this. It can release electric discharges of varying intensity. In the Pokémon the Series episode Sparks Fly for Magnemite, Pikachu is shown to build up energy in its glands, which it will need to discharge to avoid complications. It is also able to release energy through its tail, which acts as a grounding rod, as well as recharge fellow Pikachu with electric shocks. Pikachu and its evolutionary relatives are related to Pachirisu. As shown in Pokémon Sleep, Pikachu is known to generate electricity through its cheeks while sleeping. Pikachu discharges while sleeping due to it dreaming of firing electric shots.[1]

Pikachu and its evolutionary relatives are the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Volt Tackle. Pikachu is also the only known Pokémon capable of using the Z-Move Catastropika, and the only known Pokémon capable of using the Light Ball item.

Forms
Pikachu has sixteen additional forms that fall into four groups: Cosplay Pikachu, Pikachu in a cap, the partner Pikachu, and Gigantamax Pikachu. Additionally, many other Pikachu variants have appeared in various media.

Cosplay Pikachu
Cosplay Pikachu is always female, has a black heart-shaped spot at the end of its tail, and can be dressed in any of five outfits corresponding to the five Contest conditions.

Cosplay Pikachu	Pikachu Rock Star	Pikachu Belle	Pikachu Pop Star	Pikachu, Ph.D	Pikachu Libre
					
Pikachu in a cap
Pikachu in a cap is always male and has eight variants, each wearing one of Ash's hats from Pokémon the Series. Pikachu in a cap is the only known Pokémon capable of using the Z-Move 10,000,000 Volt Thunderbolt. Pikachu in a Cap cannot use Catastropika or Gigantamax.

Partner Pikachu
The partner Pikachu is the Pokémon the player starts with in Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu!. This Pikachu can be either gender. It has higher base stats than normal Pikachu. Unlike other Pikachu, the partner Pikachu can learn the exclusive moves Zippy Zap, Floaty Fall, and Splishy Splash, as well as having access to the Partner Power Pika Papow.

The partner Pikachu is not differentiated from standard Pikachu in Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu! and Let's Go, Eevee!'s Pokédex, and it cannot be transferred out of the games.

Partner Pikachu



Gigantamax Pikachu
As Gigantamax Pikachu, it becomes larger and chubbier. Its tail becomes longer and becomes capable of storing all of the electricity it generates, causing it to glow a bright yellow and enabling it to become as powerful as a lightning strike. Three red clouds float around the tail. Its power is equal to that of a power plant; however, it is difficult to use it in peoples' homes since Pikachu can only remain in its Gigantamax form for a short time.[2] Gigantamax Pikachu is the only known Pokémon capable of using the G-Max Move G-Max Volt Crash.

Gigantamax Pikachu

Evolution
Pikachu evolves from Pichu and evolves into Raichu.

In Alola, it evolves into Alolan Raichu.

Cosplay Pikachu, Pikachu in a cap, Partner Pikachu, and Pikachu with the Gigantamax Factor cannot evolve.

As the player
Main article: Pikachu (PokéPark)
Pikachu appears as the player character in both PokéPark Wii: Pikachu's Adventure and its sequel, PokéPark 2: Wonders Beyond. He falls down a mysterious tunnel one day with his friends Charmander, Chikorita, and Piplup and ends up in the PokéPark. There he goes on a quest to save the PokéPark from certain destruction. He later travels to a new PokéPark which is being threatened by the ever-expanding Wish Park. At the new PokéPark he meets Snivy, Tepig, and Oshawott, and they help to save the PokéPark from danger.

NPC appearances
Pokémon Stadium: Pikachu stars in the mini-game "Thundering Dynamo" alongside Voltorb. This mini-game involves charging up electric power.
Hey You, Pikachu!: Pikachu stars alongside an unnamed child (who bears a striking resemblance to Red) who was recently taught how to interact with wild Pokémon by Professor Oak. The boy and Pikachu form a bond and go on many adventures together, and one day the Pikachu decides to live with the boy.
Pokémon Stadium 2: Pikachu can be used in "Pichu's Power Plant" if one is detected in a Transferred Pokémon game.
Pokémon Pinball: Pikachu serves as a Ball-Saver, but it will only work if the Lightning Meter is full.
Pokémon Pinball: Ruby & Sapphire: Pikachu has the same role as in Pokémon Pinball but is sometimes helped by Pichu. Pikachu also appears on the Catch 'Em Mode banner.
Pokémon Channel: Much like Hey You, Pikachu!, Pokémon Channel focuses on a boy and a Pikachu bonding through social interactions, such as going outside and talking to other Pokémon, and watching TV together.

Form data
Pikachu has sixteen additional forms that fall into four groups: Cosplay Pikachu, Pikachu in a cap, the partner Pikachu, and Gigantamax Pikachu. All forms except the partner Pikachu are recognized by an in-game Pokédex; partner Pikachu has only been named in promotional materials.[3]

Cosplay Pikachu
Cosplay Pikachu is the base form of a group of six interchangeable forms exclusive to Pokémon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire. It is a female Pikachu who has a black, heart-shaped mark at the end of its tail, obtained from a Pokémon Breeder after the player takes part in their first Pokémon Contest Spectacular. Cosplay Pikachu can change forms by dressing up in different costumes corresponding to each of the five contest conditions (Coolness, Beauty, Cuteness, Cleverness, and Toughness); each form also automatically learns a move that Pikachu otherwise could not learn. Cosplay Pikachu can change or remove its costume at any Contest Hall, forgetting the move it learned with the last costume (if it still knows it) and learning the move from the new costume (if applicable). If Cosplay Pikachu removes its costume while the only move it knows is the move tied to its costume, it learns Thunder Shock.

Unlike other Pikachu, Cosplay Pikachu cannot evolve or breed. It also cannot be traded via the GTS or Wonder Trade. Additionally, as it is not present in any games besides Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire, Cosplay Pikachu cannot be deposited into Pokémon Bank, and it does not register as a separate form in Pokémon Bank's Pokédex, despite it registering separately in the Pokédex of Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire.

Pikachu in a cap
Pikachu in a cap are eight event-exclusive, non-interchangeable forms of Pikachu that debuted in Pokémon Sun and Moon. Like Ash's Pikachu, these Pikachu are always male, and they cannot evolve or breed. They are also able to use the event-exclusive Z-Crystal Pikashunium Z and its corresponding Z-Move 10,000,000 Volt Thunderbolt. Their cries differ from that of regular Pikachu. They are not present in Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu! and Let's Go, Eevee!, Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl, or Pokémon Legends: Arceus.

Six variants exist in Pokémon Sun and Moon, one for each of Ash's hats from the original series to Pokémon the Series: Sun & Moon. A seventh variant debuted in Pokémon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon, wearing the Partner Cap, Ash's hat from Pokémon the Movie: I Choose You!. An eighth variant debuted in the Version 1.2.0 update of Pokémon Sword and Shield, wearing the World Cap, Ash's hat from Pokémon Journeys: The Series.

Pikachu in Pokémon Journeys: The Series

Captain Pikachu in Pokémon Horizons: The Series
Main series
Major appearances
Ash's Pikachu
Ash has a Pikachu that he obtained from Professor Oak in Pokémon - I Choose You!, the first episode of Pokémon the Series, which also marked its debut. He was the signature Pokémon of the animated series from the original series to Pokémon Journeys: The Series and appeared in almost every non-special episode and every Pokémon movie released throughout that point. In The Climb to Be the Very Best!, he was revealed to be capable of Gigantamaxing. He always remains outside of his Poké Ball.

Pikachutwo
In Mewtwo Strikes Back, Mewtwo cloned Ash's Pikachu. This Pikachu can be distinguished from Ash's due to the spikes in the black marks found on the tips of its ears. It is also comparatively more aggressive than Ash's Pikachu and slurs its speech, defects possibly caused by Ash tampering with Mewtwo's cloning machine during the cloning process. It reappeared in the sequel special Mewtwo Returns and the remake movie Mewtwo Strikes Back—Evolution.

Puka
A Pikachu nicknamed Puka was owned by Victor on Seafoam Island in The Pi-Kahuna. This blue-eyed Pikachu saved Ash from drowning by having the ability to sense tidal waves approaching.

Ritchie has a Pikachu nicknamed Sparky, who debuted in A Friend In Deed. Sparky, unlike most Pikachu, has a tuft of fur on the top of its head, and, unlike Ash's Pikachu, has no problem with living inside a Poké Ball.

Pikachu in the TCG

Pikachu TCG Coin
Main article: Pikachu (TCG)
Pikachu manages to find its way into many of the expansions, causing there to be 218 known non-reprint Pokémon cards featuring Pikachu. There are also various Trainer cards with Pikachu in the card's artwork too, including the very sought-after tournament promos such as No.1 Trainer.

The first Pikachu that appeared in the TCG was Pikachu in the Base Set (which was reprinted in Base Set 2 and in POP Series 2 with different artwork). It was followed in the next set by another Pikachu (which was also reprinted in the Legendary Collection). The third Pikachu card released was the first-ever English promo card, Pikachu. The original Base Set Pikachu was also released as a special promotional card at E3.

In the early days of the TCG, several notable errors were made regarding the Pikachu cards. The Base Set Pikachu was released with altered artwork at first, depicting it with red cheeks, instead of the original yellow. While this matched Ken Sugimori's artwork, the yellow color on its cheeks was intentional by the artist, who depicted Pikachu using ThunderShock. This error appeared in both the E3 promotional version and the normal Base Set release. A second error was made in the production of Jungle set booster packs, which, instead of the Jungle set's Pikachu, sometimes contained first edition versions of the Pikachu that was released as a promo card.

Pikachu has also been featured on a number of TCG coins, with one being included with the English and European languages-only Base Set 2. This coin was also featured in the Pokémon Play It! PC game. A Pikachu coin is also featured in the Game Boy game Pokémon Trading Card Game, and is one of the coins that can be obtained in Pokémon Trading Card Game 2: The Invasion of Team GR!, where it is given by Isaac to winners of the Lightning Club.

In the TFG
Two Pikachu figures have been released.

Pikachu overwhelms opponents with powerful electric shocks and quick movements.[4]

Pikachu Libre was first announced alongside the Wii U port of the game. She was later released as an additional fighter on the original arcade version.

Trivia
Pikachu and its evolved form both share their category with Rattata, Raticate, Sandshrew, Sandslash, Pawmi, and Pawmo. They are all known as the Mouse Pokémon, though Rattata and Raticate were originally called the Rat Pokémon prior to Generation III.
Veronica Taylor has said Pikachu is her favorite Pokémon. Sarah Natochenny has as well, shared with Mew.
Pikachu is the only Pokémon that serves as the player's first Pokémon in the core series games that has a pre-evolved form. However, Pichu (its pre-evolved form) does not exist in either game in which it fills this role.
Pikachu has the most event-exclusive moves available to it.
Pikachu is the only Pokémon with two exclusive Z-Moves.
When starting a new game in Pokémon Yellow, Pikachu's front sprite appears with a slightly different color palette (the palette index number 0x10) than usual when it is introduced by Professor Oak. This is the same red/yellow palette used for Mew, Mewtwo, and Jynx (except the Virtual Console Jynx), as well as the battle sprites of all Pokémon Trainers.
Due to the color palette used at the start of Pokémon Yellow, Pikachu has red cheeks (in the Game Boy Color) or pink cheeks (in the Super Game Boy). However, in this game's normal gameplay, Pikachu has dark orange cheeks instead.
In Pokémon Yellow and from Generation VI to Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl, Pikachu uses its animated series cry (voiced by Ikue Otani). Before Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu! and Let's Go, Eevee!, it was the only Pokémon to do so in the core series games.
Its battle cry differs from status or Pokédex screens.
The Pikachu received at the beginning of Pokémon Yellow has unique voice clips in Pokémon Stadium and Stadium 2.
In Pokémon Legends: Arceus and Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, it uses an updated version of its original cry, like other Pokémon.
Pikachu is the only core series first partner Pokémon that does not have a 7:1 gender ratio.
Pokémon Black, White, Black 2, and White 2 are the only core series games in which Pikachu cannot be obtained without transporting or through an event.
Pikachu is the only not fully evolved Pokémon whose base stats increased in Generation VI, as well as the only Pokémon to receive more than one stat increase: Defense and Special Defense.
Pikachu is the 25th Pokémon in both the National Pokédex and Alola Pokédex in Pokémon Sun and Moon.
In the Japanese Pokémon Stadium, Pikachu is the only usable Pokémon that is not fully evolved.
Pikachu is the only Pokémon that can be caught in all three pinball titles: Pokémon Pinball, Pokémon Pinball mini, and Pokémon Pinball: Ruby & Sapphire.
According to A Sneak Peek at Pokémon, Pikachu can deliver a constant current of 1000 amperes.
Pikachu is currently represented in the Trading Card Game by more cards than any other Pokémon, with 218 unique cards.
On December 11, 2023, Google revealed that Pikachu was the "most searched Pokémon" in the platform's history during its 25 years of creation.[5][6]
Merchandise

Pikachu in Pokémon Battle Chess
Pikachu appears in Pokémon Battle Chess. It doesn't behave like any traditional piece in chess but behaves like a gold general in shogi.
Pikachu was the focus of a Pokémon Center collection in June 2014.
Real life
The Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade has included three Pikachu balloons. "Flying Pikachu" was the first, flown from 2001 to 2005, and was used in a morning rush hour test of wind conditions in Times Square after an accident involving an M&M's balloon in the 2005 parade.[7] It was last used in the August 2006 Party of the Decade in New York City's Bryant Park. The second balloon debuted in the 2006 parade, features glowing cheeks, and chases a Poké Ball balloon. The third, introduced in the 2014 parade, wears a green scarf and holds a small, Pikachu-shaped snowman.
Cultural impact

$1 coin from Niue featuring Pikachu
The nation of Niue released a one-dollar coin with its coat of arms on one side and Pikachu on the other to promote the Pokémon franchise.
Pikachu has served as the inspiration for the naming of several scientific discoveries:
In 2008, Japanese researchers discovered a new protein that helps carry electrical impulses from the eyes to the brain and named it pikachurin. According to them, it was so named for sharing Pikachu's "lightning-fast moves and shocking electric effects".
The springtail species Dicranocentrus pikachu was named after Pikachu.[8]
The spider species Epicratinus pikachu was named after Pikachu due to the female spider's epigynum resembling its face.[9]
The spider species Alistra pikachu was named after Pikachu due to its yellow coloration.[10]
The beetle species Hiperantha pikachu was named after Pikachu because of its yellow elytra with a black apical band that resembles Pikachu's ears.[11]
Concept and development
Pikachu was designed by Atsuko Nishida, a core designer at Game Freak.[12][13] Pikachu had a short, stout design during the initial release of Pokémon Red and Green, but its design was altered for Pokémon the Series and subsequent entries of the games, becoming slightly taller and skinnier. According to Ken Sugimori, Pikachu's design was altered to make animating its actions easier.[13] Pikachu is depicted with a white belly similar to its evolved form Raichu in the Pocket Monsters Carddass Trading Cards as seen here.

Pikachu also originally had a second-stage Evolution named "Gorochu" (Japanese: ゴロチュウ Gorochū), which would have had two horns and fangs.[14][15] Sugimori stated that while there was nothing wrong with its appearance, it was nonetheless omitted from Pokémon Red and Green, as the staff found that the game balance was better without it, and the limited game space meant that some Pokémon originally designed to evolve twice were changed to evolve only once.[13]

Gigantamax Pikachu was designed by James Turner.[16]

Origin
Pikachu was originally a daifuku-like creature with ears sticking out. Its black ear tips are remnants of this original concept.[13][15]

Nishida named the Pokémon Pikachu "without giving it much thought", and while it wasn't originally intended to be based on a mouse, Game Freak CEO Satoshi Tajiri made the decision to base it on such. During the process of making Pikachu "cuter", as per the instructions of game designer Kōji Nishino, Nishida added cheek pouches for it to store electricity in. These were inspired by squirrels, which store food in their cheeks. Pikachu's yellow coloration and lightning bolt-shaped tail were given to express Pikachu's electrical attributes and make its type easier to recognise and understand. According to Nishida, Pikachu's stripes aren't based on anything in particular, and were added to fill the empty space on Pikachu's back, as it is always visible during battle.[13][15]

Pikachu's Gigantamax form is a reference to its earlier, more rotund design from Generations I and II.[17]

Name origin
Pikachu is a combination of ピカピカ pikapika (onomatopoeia for sparkle) and チューチュー chūchū (the sound of a mouse squeaking).[13][18]
