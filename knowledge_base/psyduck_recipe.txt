# Psyduck Confit with Psychic-Infused Sauce

**Preparation:** This challenging dish requires careful timing, as stress can cause the Psyduck to release powerful psychic bursts that may inadvertently pre-cook the meat in unpredictable ways. Cure the duck legs in salt, bay leaves, and lavender for 12 hours, then gently poach in duck fat at 200Â°F for 2-3 hours until fork-tender. The meat has a peculiar quality - it seems to anticipate your taste preferences, somehow adjusting its flavor profile to match your cravings before you even take a bite. The rendered fat carries trace psychic energy that creates an almost hypnotic richness, while the crispy skin crackles with an otherworldly electricity. Serve with a sauce made from the cooking juices and wild mushrooms, though diners may experience brief moments of telepathic connection with their meal - a side effect that has made this dish both sought after and slightly unsettling.
