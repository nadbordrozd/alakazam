Pokemon-related household accidents are more common than most trainers admit. Charmander tail fires have caused countless house fires when the Pokemon got excited during TV shows. Pikachu static discharge regularly fries electronics, with insurance companies now specifically excluding "electric-type incidents" from standard policies. One documented case involved a Machamp who tried to help with spring cleaning and accidentally punched through three load-bearing walls. Psychic-types are notorious for rearranging furniture in the middle of the night, leading to countless stubbed toes. Perhaps most frustratingly, Ghost-types often phase through floors while sleeping, only to get stuck halfway and spend hours moaning pitifully until their trainers figure out where the mysterious crying is coming from.
